## Tax Considerations for Swiss Investors

### Swiss Tax Implications
- Preference for accumulating ETFs over distributing ETFs for tax efficiency
- Consider Swiss-domiciled ETFs to avoid US withholding tax on dividends (for US-exposure)
- Be aware of Swiss stamp duty on purchases (0.075% for Swiss securities, 0.15% for foreign securities)
- Consider ETFs qualifying for "Swiss reporting status" to simplify tax reporting

### Withholding Tax Optimization
- For US exposure, consider Irish-domiciled ETFs to reduce withholding tax from 30% to 15%
- For Swiss exposure, consider Swiss-domiciled funds to minimize withholding tax complications

## Implementation Considerations

### Portfolio Rebalancing
- Annual rebalancing recommended to maintain target allocations
- Consider tax implications when rebalancing

### Monitoring and Evaluation
- Regular review of ETF performance vs. benchmarks
- Annual review of expense ratios and fund changes
- Monitor for tracking error to ensure the ETF follows its index properly

### Entry Strategy
- Consider dollar-cost averaging for initial investment to mitigate timing risk
- For larger deposits, phased entry over 3-6 months may be prudent
