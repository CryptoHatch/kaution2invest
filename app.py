ðŸ’¡ **Understanding Compound Interest**

With compound interest, your investment grows not just on the initial amount, but also on the accumulated interest 
over time. This creates an accelerating growth effect:

- **Year 1**: You earn interest only on your initial deposit
- **Year 2+**: You earn interest on both your initial deposit AND previous interest

This is why the investment growth curve bends upward over longer time periods.

### How to Interpret These Results

- The **0% Return** (red line) represents your deposit if left in a standard rental deposit account with no interest.
- The **Investment Return** (blue line with markers) shows how your money could grow if invested at the selected rate.
- Notice how the blue line curves upward over time - this is the **compound interest effect** in action.
- In later years, your investment grows faster because you're earning interest on previously earned interest.

**Example calculation:** For an initial deposit of 5,400 CHF at 3% annual return:
- After 1 year: 5,400 CHF Ã— (1 + 0.03) = 5,562 CHF
- After 2 years: 5,400 CHF Ã— (1 + 0.03)Â² = 5,729 CHF (not just 5,724 CHF)

**Note:** This is a simplified calculation that assumes consistent annual returns and does not account for inflation, taxes, or investment fees.
